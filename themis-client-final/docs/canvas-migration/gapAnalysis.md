# Gap Analysis: Themis Canvas vs. Obsidian Advanced Canvas

This document compares the existing Themis IdeationCanvas implementation with the Obsidian Advanced Canvas plugin, highlighting key differences and gaps that need to be addressed during the integration.

## Canvas Core & Rendering

| Feature | Themis IdeationCanvas | Obsidian Advanced Canvas | Gap Analysis |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Rendering Engine | React + direct DOM manipulation | Custom DOM manipulation | Themis uses React for components while Obsidian uses direct DOM manipulation. Need to wrap Obsidian's rendering in React components or port the functionality. |
| Zoom Implementation | CSS transform scaling with manual adjustments | Complex viewport transformations | Themis has basic zoom but lacks advanced viewport management and smooth scaling across large ranges. |
| Panning | Basic CSS transform translation | Optimized canvas transformations | Themis panning works but has performance issues with large canvases. |
| Performance | Lower performance with large canvases | Optimized for large canvases | Need performance improvements for handling 500+ nodes at 60fps. |
| Element Layering | Basic z-index | Sophisticated z-ordering system | Need to implement proper z-ordering and layering system. |

## Data Model & Types

| Feature | Themis IdeationCanvas | Obsidian Advanced Canvas | Gap Analysis |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Card Types | Basic text, webpage, image | Text, file, link, group | Need to add support for file nodes and improve group containers. |
| Connection Types | Simple connections with labels | Sophisticated edge system with styles and endpoints | Need to implement directional arrows, connection styles, and better edge routing. |
| Group Implementation | Simple groups without collapsing | Advanced collapsible groups | Need to implement collapsible groups with proper containment semantics. |
| Data Serialization | No standardized format | Well-defined canvas JSON format | Need to implement .canvas.json format compatibility. |
| History Management | None | Full undo/redo stack | Need to implement undo/redo functionality. |

## User Interaction

| Feature | Themis IdeationCanvas | Obsidian Advanced Canvas | Gap Analysis |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Selection System | Basic selection | Multi-select with advanced features | Need to improve multi-select capabilities and selection manipulation. |
| Drag & Drop | Basic implementation | Advanced with snapping | Need to implement snap-to-grid and snap-to-objects utilities. |
| Resize Handling | Basic corner resize | Multi-direction resize with aspect ratio | Need to implement better resize handles and maintain aspect ratios. |
| Keyboard Shortcuts | Limited | Extensive keyboard controls | Need to implement comprehensive keyboard shortcut system. |
| Context Menus | Basic menu | Context-aware menus with sub-menus | Need to enhance context menu capabilities. |

## Advanced Features

| Feature | Themis IdeationCanvas | Obsidian Advanced Canvas | Gap Analysis |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Minimap | Missing | Present | Need to implement minimap for global navigation. |
| Export | Missing | PNG, SVG, PDF export | Need to implement all export formats. |
| Node Styling | Basic color options | Advanced styling system | Need to implement comprehensive styling system. |
| Edge Styling | Basic styling | Advanced edge styling | Need to implement edge styling options. |
| Collapsible Groups | Missing | Present | Need to implement collapsible group functionality. |
| Presentation Mode | Missing | Present | Need to evaluate if presentation mode is required. |
| Portals | Missing | Present | Need to evaluate if portal functionality is needed. |

## Integration Requirements

| Requirement | Themis IdeationCanvas | Obsidian Advanced Canvas | Integration Approach |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| React Integration | Native React | No React | Wrap canvas functionality in React components; maintain React component lifecycle. |
| State Management | React state hooks | Custom state management | Integrate with Redux store; create canvasSlice for state. |
| Persistence | Manual saving | Autosave | Implement autosave middleware. |
| Theming | Material UI theming | Custom CSS | Adapt styling to work with Material UI theme system. |
| Mobile Support | Responsive design | Limited mobile optimization | Ensure responsive behavior is maintained. |

## Performance Requirements

| Metric | Current Themis | Target with Integration | Gap |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|-----|
| Canvas Load Time | >500ms for medium canvas | <200ms for large canvas | Need significant performance optimization. |
| Rendering Performance | Drops below 30fps with 100+ nodes | Maintain 60fps with 500+ nodes | Need rendering optimization. |
| Memory Usage | High with large canvases | Optimized for large canvases | Need memory optimization strategies. |
| Export Speed | N/A | <3 seconds for large canvas | Need efficient export implementation. |

## UI/UX Considerations

| Aspect | Themis IdeationCanvas | Obsidian Advanced Canvas | Integration Approach |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| UI Consistency | Consistent with Themis | Obsidian-specific | Maintain Themis UI patterns and visual language. |
| Toolbar | Top toolbar | Bottom/floating toolbar | Keep Themis toolbar approach but incorporate advanced features. |
| Modals/Dialogs | Material UI dialogs | Custom dialogs | Use Material UI components for all dialogs. |
| Tooltips | Material UI tooltips | Custom tooltips | Maintain Material UI tooltip system. |
| Feedback Indicators | Limited | Extensive visual feedback | Implement better visual feedback for interactions. |
