# Calendar View

The Calendar view provides a unified view of all time-based items in the system, including tasks, assignments, meetings, and project deadlines.

## Accessing the Calendar

You can access the Calendar view by clicking on the "Calendar" item in the main navigation menu, which is located just below "Dashboard".

## Calendar Features

The Calendar view offers the following features:

### Different Calendar Views

- **Month View**: Default view showing all events in a monthly calendar grid.
- **Week View**: Shows events for a single week with hour divisions.
- **Day View**: Shows events for a single day with detailed hour divisions.
- **List View**: Shows events in a list format for easy scanning.

You can switch between these views using the buttons in the top-right corner of the calendar.

### Color-Coded Events

All events are color-coded to help you quickly identify their type:

- **Tasks** - Blue
- **Assignments** - Green
- **Meetings** - Violet
- **Project Deadlines** - Red

A legend is provided at the top of the calendar for easy reference.

### Interacting with Events

- **Click** on any event to view its details. This will open the corresponding detail view for that item type.
- **Drag and Drop** events to reschedule them (if you have the appropriate permissions).
- **Hover** over an event to see a tooltip with basic information.

### Project Deadlines

Project deadlines are shown as all-day events on their respective dates. These events are displayed as "<Project Name> deadline" and are colored red for high visibility.

> **Note**: Project deadlines cannot be rescheduled via drag-and-drop. These dates must be modified through the Project Details page as they represent official project milestones.

## Permissions and Visibility

The Calendar view respects the same role-based visibility rules as the rest of the system:

- **Project Managers** - Only see events from projects they belong to.
- **Sub-PMOs and Department Directors** - See events from any project in their department.
- **Executives and the Main PMO** - See events from all projects.

## Notifications

The system will send notifications for time-based calendar events:

- 15 minutes before a meeting starts
- 1 hour before an assignment is due
- 24 hours before a project deadline

## Tips for Using the Calendar

- Use the "today" button to quickly return to the current day.
- Navigate between months, weeks, or days using the arrow buttons.
- If you have many events, switch to list view for a more condensed overview.
- Remember that project deadlines cannot be rescheduled via drag-and-drop.
