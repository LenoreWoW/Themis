# Themis Security Update Instructions

## What Was Fixed

We've successfully addressed all security vulnerabilities in the project:

1. Created a clean version of the project with 0 vulnerabilities (located at `/Users/hassanalsahli/Desktop/themis-clean/`)
2. Updated all dependencies to their latest secure versions
3. Added package overrides to enforce secure versions of critical packages:
   - `postcss`: Updated to v8.4.35
   - `nth-check`: Updated to v2.1.1 
   - `svgo`: Updated to v3.2.0
   - `css-select`: Updated to v5.1.0
4. Added missing development dependencies required by React Scripts 5.0.1
5. Removed vulnerable dependencies like `xlsx` and replaced them with secure alternatives

## How to Update Your Project

To apply these changes to your main project:

### Option 1: Copy the Fixed Project

The simplest approach is to:

1. Back up your current project
2. Copy the fixed project to replace your current one:

```bash
# Back up current project
cp -r /Users/hassanalsahli/Desktop/Themis/themis-client /Users/hassanalsahli/Desktop/Themis/themis-client-backup

# Copy fixed project
cp -r /Users/hassanalsahli/Desktop/themis-clean/. /Users/hassanalsahli/Desktop/Themis/themis-client/
```

### Option 2: Update Your Existing Project

If you prefer to update your existing project:

1. Update your package.json with the changes below
2. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
3. Run npm install

#### Key Changes to package.json:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Update these packages
    "postcss": "^8.4.35",
    // Remove resolve-url-loader from dependencies if present
    // Other dependencies from the updated package.json
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // Add these packages
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object": "^7.21.11",
    "@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin": "^0.5.11",
    "@svgr/webpack": "^8.1.0",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.2",
    "@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
    "@types/dompurify": "^3.0.5",
    "@types/jest": "^29.5.12",
    "css-loader": "^6.10.0",
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^5.6.0",
    "nth-check": "^2.1.1",
    "postcss-flexbugs-fixes": "^5.0.2",
    "postcss-normalize": "^10.0.1", 
    "postcss-preset-env": "^9.3.0",
    "resolve-url-loader": "^5.0.0",
    "source-map-loader": "^5.0.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^4.15.1"
    // Other dev dependencies from the updated package.json
  },
  // Add this overrides section
  "overrides": {
    "postcss": "^8.4.35",
    "nth-check": "^2.1.1",
    "svgo": "^3.2.0",
    "css-select": "^5.1.0"
  }
}
```

## Verification

After applying the changes, verify that no vulnerabilities remain:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
npm audit
```

The output should show "0 vulnerabilities".

## Notes

1. Some dependencies will show deprecation warnings during installation, but these are not security vulnerabilities.
2. The updated project uses React Scripts 5.0.1, which is more secure than previous versions.
3. If you use any features that were removed from the fixed version, you may need to restore them individually.
4. The "overrides" section in package.json ensures that even if nested dependencies try to use vulnerable versions, they'll be replaced with secure ones.
5. This update is focused on security - you might need to make small code changes if there are breaking changes in some of the updated libraries.
