# Themis Security Improvements

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

We addressed several key security vulnerabilities in the Themis project:

1. **Removed `react-mindmap`**: This package had dependencies on vulnerable versions of `d3-color` and `static-server` packages.

2. **Replaced `xlsx` with `exceljs`**: The `xlsx` package had high severity vulnerabilities related to prototype pollution and Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) with no available fix. `exceljs` is a more secure and modern alternative.

3. **Updated dependencies**:
   - Updated `postcss` to version 8.4.31 to address line return parsing errors
   - Updated `resolve-url-loader` to version 5.0.0
   - Updated `minimist` to latest version
   - Updated `nth-check` to latest version
   - Installed development versions of `css-select`, `svgo`, and `@svgr/webpack` with fixed vulnerabilities

## Remaining Vulnerabilities

Despite these improvements, some vulnerabilities remain because they're deeply embedded in the `react-scripts` dependency tree and would require breaking changes to fix. These include:

1. Issues with the webpack development server
2. Vulnerabilities in various PostCSS plugins
3. Various vulnerabilities in other development dependencies

The safest way to address these remaining vulnerabilities would be to:

1. Upgrade `react-scripts` to version 5+ (potentially requiring code changes)
2. Consider migrating to a more modern build system like Vite or Next.js

## Security Best Practices for Future Development

To maintain good security posture:

1. **Regular Dependency Audits**:
   - Run `npm audit` regularly 
   - Address high and critical vulnerabilities promptly

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - When adding new dependencies, check their security status with `npm audit`
   - Look for alternatives to packages with unresolved vulnerabilities
   - Consider using a tool like Dependabot for automated vulnerability notifications

3. **Code Security**:
   - Follow secure coding practices to prevent XSS and other common web vulnerabilities
   - Use proper input validation and sanitization
   - Consider implementing Content Security Policy (CSP)

4. **Documentation**:
   - Keep this document updated with security improvements
   - Document known vulnerabilities that cannot be addressed immediately

## How to Check for Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities (when possible without breaking changes)
npm audit fix

# Fix vulnerabilities (may introduce breaking changes)
npm audit fix --force
```

When new versions of key dependencies become available, consider upgrading:

```bash
npm install package-name@latest --save --legacy-peer-deps
```
